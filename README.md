# Six-Bar-Function-Generation-Synthesis-Tool
Python tool for function-generation synthesis of six-bar mechanisms (Watt I/II, Stephenson I/II/III) using Differential Evolution. Features full kinematic modeling, constraint checking, real-time plots, and a GUI for setup and export. Applications include function approximation, biomechanics, and prosthetic design.

Features:
Function-generation synthesis for N precision points
Differential Evolution optimization
Geometric position analysis for all mechanism types
Transmission quality metrics
Detection of branch, circuit, and order defects
Graphical interface for setting parameters, launching optimizations, visualizing mechanisms, generating plots, and exporting CSV files
Applications include function approximation, biomechanics, and prosthetic mechanism design.
